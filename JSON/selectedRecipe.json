Sprinkle over a little salt, and put the cubes in between pieces of kitchen paper. Put a heavy board over the top and leave to press for 30 minutes  1 hour to drain off some of the water.To make the salsa, mix all the ingredients with half the lime juice and season. Toss the cabbage with the remaining lime juice and a pinch of salt.Mix 2 tsp oil and all the spices with some seasoning in a bowl. Add the tofu pieces and toss gently to coat.
